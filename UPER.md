<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
Creating a multi-functional layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
*
Make pseudo display/wireframe for each view size
*
Making sure all divs work and conform to each size
*
Make the number of items part of the product attributes or not?
*
Should components just be search/header, sidebar for the cart, and main gallery display?
*
Should each display item be a component?
*
Should search update main display?
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*
"Simplicity is the best sophistication": no components
*
Review flexbox to make the app responsive
*
Use stand in divs to make sure layout is working correctly
*
Revisit 2nd set of React videos for info on json format and search functionality
*
For moving items to cart, revisit the to-do list app for adding new items to a div
*
Create function to update quantity when purchasing items/adding to cart
*
Bring in images in an array
*
Have search display separate 
*
For error handling, use alert
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*
Add fixed button to Add to Cart make it fixed so they can see it after scroll 
*
Made buttons sticky to keep them in frame
*
Used flexbox to extend purchase item on the opposite end for design
*
Made images responsive to window size
*
Made search results clickable, so as to add them to the cart
*
Search responds to any matched field, regardless of what is searched
*
Thank the guest for their purchase
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*
Felt like code would've been cleaner with components
*
App was made with mobile design in mind
*
Design an auto scroll function on image hover
*
Improve search functionality by increasing its precision
*
Softer UI, I don't like the hard corners
