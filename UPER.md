- R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
Creating a multi-functional layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
*
Make pseudo display/wireframe for each view size
*
Making sure all divs work conform to each size
*
Make the number of items part of the product attributes or not?
*
Should components just be search/header, sidebar for the cart, and main gallery display?
*
Should each display item be a component?
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*
Review flexbox to make the app responsive
*
Use stand in divs to make sure layout is working correctly
*
Revisit 2nd set of React videos for info on json format and search functionality
*
For moving items to cart, revisit the to-do list app for adding new items to a div
